# Winsurance Tower Defense

Author: Levi Huillet

Theme: Tower Defense

Feature: Multiplayer Sync

Learning Objectives: Insurance (why it's important and Adverse Selection)


Game Overview:

	You are managing a weather control station in the birthplace of all the world's storms and natural disasters. As you can imagine, this location affords lots of research opportunities, but also high risks. Heavy infrastructure damage is common.
	Luckily, you can buy insurance. You and other stations in the region are all insured under a company called Win-surance Co.
	This game teaches basic principles of insurance (such as why someone might want insurance), as well as the more advanced principle of insurance known as Adverse Selection.


Tower Defense Aspects:

	- Oncoming elements take a shortest path from their starting point to the player's base
	
	- Players can place their towers on the grid in valid cells (designated for towers and empty)

	- Players can select from multiple types of towers, each which have their own specifications (range, cost, etc.)
	
	- The player's base has health that depletes whenever a natural disaster reaches it


Insurance Aspects:
	
	- Buy insurance against natural disasters (hurricanes, wildfires, and floods) that kicks in once the base health is depleted
	
	- Player can choose whether to buy insurance (and pay the resulting premiums)
	
	- Game is broken into periods. Natural disasters have a specified chance of occuring each period, and they get more extreme each period.


Multiplayer Aspects:

	- Nothing yet, but working on requesting and sending aid to other players, each managing their own base.

	- Once they are implemented, multiple players will be key for teaching about Adverse Selection
	
	
Miscellaneous Mechanics:

	- Elements spawn out of Nexuses, which in turn spawn from Chaos Butterflies. Every butterfly that crosses the screen has a chance to instigate a Nexus pretty much anywhere, which grows and grows before moving to its designated spawn point. How many enemies a Nexus spawns depends on how much it grew during its growth stage.

	- Player receives $35 per period to pay for towers and insurance
